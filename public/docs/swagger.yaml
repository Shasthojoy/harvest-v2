                           ## What is HarvestAPI?
                           The Harvest API is an open data platform for the publishing and sharing of agricultural sector data across government and with the public. It was developed by the SlashRoots Foundation in collaboration with Jamaica’s Rural Agricultural Development Authority’s (RADA) and Ministry of Agriculture (MoA). Through HarvestAPI RADA and the MoA publish and manage the sharing of crop production and farmer and farm registry data from RADA’s ABIS database as well as market price information from the MoA’s JAMIS database.
                           ### What is an API?
                           Simply put, an application programming interface (API) is a set of functions and procedures that allow the creation of applications which access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.
                           ### Open Source Project
                           This is an open source project which means the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified. The source code may be found [here on github](https://github.com/slashroots/harvest-v2)
                           ## ABIS & Relationship with RADA
                           ABIS is a web-based information programme developed by RADA, which provides information on crops, livestock, and agricultural production, markets and stakeholders, to support the business of agriculture.
    - name: What data does the API use?
      description: |
                           Harvest API uses data from ABIS, but only  providing non personal data to developers and the public.
                           # Data Resources
                           Data resources currently being offered are:
                           - Crops
                           - Farmer
                           - Livestock
                           - Property

                           ## Personal vs Aggregate
                           Aggregate data on a resource is accessed through a respective resource path, which has the resource pluralized. e.g `/api/crops` would return ALL the crops available. As you can imagine, this would return a large amount of data. So, we've allowed you to limit/[throttle](/docs/#throttling-requests) the aggregate requests.
                           Personal requests are those which retrieve a specific record from a resource. e.g. `/api/crop/[CROP_ID_HERE]` would return the specific crop record associated with the crop id passed in the path where `CROP_ID_HERE` is. Please note that for personal requests, the resource name is kept singular.
                           ## Throttling Requests
                           `limit` - This is the number of results that will be returned from this query (defaults to 100).
                           `offset` - This allows for pagination in sets of whatever the limit is (defaults to 0).
    - name: Aggregate Functions
      description: |
                            These functions are operations done on aggragate data endpoints. These include:
                            - `date_range`
                                > A 'date_range' parameter that allows the user to specify a field to be compared with a date range by also specifying either a `start_date`, an `end_date`, or both. If only one is specified,
                                > it will return all the results with a date after the start date or before the end date accordingly. Example query;
                                ```
                                /api/crops?end_date=2012-08-31&start_date=2012-08-01&date_range=Plant_Date&District=Ticky%20Ticky
                                ```
                                > This will return all the crops planted in August of 2008 in the Ticky Ticky District."
                            - `sum`
                                > A 'sum' parameter can be included with an API call and - when specified - will cause the API to return the accumulated total of all the values in that field/column.
                                > Example query;
                                ```
                                /api/crops?Crop_Name=Yam&parish=Trelawny&operation=sum&field=Crop_Total_Area
                                ```
                                > This will return the how much land is being used for yam farming in Trelawny.
                            - `avg`
                                > This computes the average of all the values from a specific field in the result set. Example query:
                                ```
                                /api/properties?District=Ticky%20Ticky&operation=avg&field=Property_Size_Ha
                                ```
                            - `min`
                                > This returns the lowest of all the values from a specific field in the result set.
                            - `max`
                                > This returns the highest of all the values from a specific field in the result set.
                            - `var`
                                > This returns the statistical variance of all the values from a specific field in the result set.
                            - `stdev`
                                > This returns the standard deviation of all the values from a specific field in the result set.
    - name: How to use the API
      description: |
                           This documentation provides all the resources offered and how they may be accessed, however, and API key/token must be passed as `access_token` within the header of the request.
                           # API Registration
                           You MUST register on ther [Harvest API website]() before interfacing with the API for any development.
                           # API Keys
                           An application programming interface key (API key) is a code passed in by computer programs calling an application programming interface (API) to identify the calling program, its developer, or its user to the Web site. Ths is done to ensure we know how the information being provided is being accessed. Remember, the api key MUST be passedin the header of the requested through the variable `access_token`.
